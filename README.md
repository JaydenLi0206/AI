# Q-learning-AI

## Introduction
This repository, 'Q-learning-AI', is dedicated to implementing Q-learning algorithms using Java. Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state.

## Structure
- `bin/`: Compiled Java class files.
- `data/`: Data files for training and testing the Q-learning models.
- `lib/`: Libraries and dependencies required.
- `params/`: Parameter configuration files for the AI models.
- `src/`: Source code in Java.
